# CARLA
 this repository is dedicated to making the logic of a self-driving car using CARLA simulator and CNN image processing
 i try to make this into a sort of 0-100 with CARLA and put the references i used to get myself going
 if you want to see more of my stuff you can check out this link:

# file categorization

 1. my_cotrol.py: copy pasta this file into "CARLA 9.5\PythonAPI\examples" and run it

 2. web_scraper.py: for automatic search of the internet

# step 1: CARLA SETUP

 1. you can download the version of CARLA you need from this link: https://carla.org/

 2. and this is a good playlist on how to get started with CARLA plus he codes a bunch of stuff using RL but i don't think RL is the right answer to this, i'm going to use CNN and image-processing to solve this problem

# step 2: IMAGE-PROCESSING (OBJECT DETECTION)

 1. in this step i'll introduce a good source for learning how object detection works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U&ab_channel=NicholasRenotte

# step 3: WEB-SCRAPING	 
 
 1. for training our model we'll need a lot of data, thus it's essential to provide that data from somewhere, i'm going to do this with a web-scraper code. file attached ---> web_scraper.py
